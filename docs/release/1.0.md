# Changes in Release 1.0.x

## New Devices

* [Stefano Sasso](https://github.com/ssasso) contributed support for Mikrotik RouterOS and VyOS devices. Both device types support IPv4, IPv6, OSPF and BGP. [More details...](../platforms.md)

## New Functionality in Release 1.0.2

* You can [set node attributes on all members in a custom group](../groups.md#setting-node-data-in-groups) with the **node_data** group attribute.
* [BGP module](../module/bgp.md) creates [custom groups based on node AS numbers](../groups.md#automatic-bgp-groups).
* Experimental release of [custom plugins](../plugins.md). I don't expect the plugin structure to change (much), but there is no well-defined API to set data structures in the rest of the *netsim* code (yet).

## New Functionality in Release 1.0.1

* [Custom groups](../groups.md) can be specified in topology file to create custom inventory groups or set inventory group variables.
* Custom groups can specify custom configuration templates that are deployed during the **[netlab up](../netlab/up.md)** process.
* **quiet** CLI flag sets Ansible STDOUT callback to **dense** to minimize the clutter generated by Ansible playbooks invoked by **netlab initial**, **netlab config** or **netlab up** commands.
* **debug** flag of **netlab up** and **netlab down** commands can be used to display commands that would be executed without executing them.

## New Functionality in Release 1.0

* **[netlab up](../netlab/up.md)** enables LLDP passthrough on Linux bridges created with *libvirt* Vagrant plugin.

## Cleanup

* Remove obsolete CLI commands and related documentation
* Remove Ubuntu installation Ansible playbook (replaced by **netlab install**)
