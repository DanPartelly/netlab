Warning in cli: Lab topology source file /home/pipi/net101/tools/tests/integration/evpn/21-bgp-ce-router.yml has been modified
... after the snapshot netlab.snapshot.yml has been created
... netlab transforms lab topology into device- and platform data and stores the results

    (including lab topology or defaults) are not automatically reflected in the snapshot
    file. Use 'netlab create' or 'netlab up' to create a new snapshot file.
