  The device under test has two VRFs with two interfaces in each VRF.
  Routers are attached to those interfaces and run BGP with device under test.
  Assuming the multi-vrf BGP test case succeeded, this one adds VRF loopback
  interfaces advertised into BGP with network statements.

  * r1 and r2 should be able to ping each other and rtr VRF loopback
  * r3 and r4 should be able to ping each other and rtr VRF loopback
  * r1 should not be able to reach r3
